Welcome to Stocker
Uhhh the stocks have no actual real life value this is just a game if you couldnt figure it out

First Js project it kinda sucks and it got harder because i was building off code from past me who had no clue what i was doing.
I got it done though!

How to play:
Press buy when low and sell when high
Pretty simple have fun!
